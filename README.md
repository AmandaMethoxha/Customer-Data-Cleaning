# Customer Data Cleaning Project

Thank you for your order!
This project includes a fully automated Python script that cleans, standardises, and prepares your customer survey data for analysis or further processing.

---

## 🧩 Files Included
- **clean_customer_data.py**  
  The main Python script that performs all cleaning operations.

- **customer_survey_raw_data.csv**  
  The original uncleaned dataset you provided.

- **customer_cleaned_output.csv**  
  The final processed and cleaned dataset generated by the script.

- **README.md**  
  Documentation and instructions (this file).

---

## ⚙️ How to Run the Script

### 1. Install required Python libraries
Make sure you have Python installed, then install the dependencies:

```
pip3 install pandas numpy
```

Or:

```
python3 -m pip install pandas numpy
```

---

### 2. Place the files together
Ensure the following files are all in the **same folder**:

```
clean_customer_data.py
customer_survey_raw_data.csv
```

---

### 3. Run the script
In your terminal, navigate to the folder and run:

```
python3 clean_customer_data.py
```

A new file named:

```
customer_cleaned_output.csv
```

will be created inside the same folder.

## 🛠️ What the Script Does

The script performs the following automated cleaning steps:

### ✅ 1. Remove Duplicate Rows
Ensures only unique entries remain.

### ✅ 2. Standardise Full Name Formatting
- Removes extra spaces  
- Normalises spacing  
- Converts names to **Title Case**

### ✅ 3. Split Full Name
Creates two new columns:
- **First Name**  
- **Last Name**

### ✅ 4. Clean Email Addresses
- Converts emails to lowercase  
- Strips extra spaces  
- Flags invalid emails (missing “@” or domain)

Invalid emails are labeled with:
```
(INVALID)
```

### ✅ 5. Clean and Convert Age
- Extracts numbers from messy age strings (e.g. “28,” → 28)  
- Converts to a clean integer  
- Leaves missing or invalid ages as blank

### ✅ 6. Clean Join Dates
Converts all date formats into one consistent format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD
```

Handles formats like:
- 2023/11/28  
- 12-03-2024  
- 2024.02.11  
- "" (empty)

### ✅ 7. Normalise Missing Values
Replaces:
```
"N/A", "n/a", "None", "", "none"
```
with actual missing-value markers.

### ✅ 8. Sort by Newest Join Date
The final CSV is sorted from most recent to oldest customer.

## 📊 Output File
The cleaned dataset is saved as:

```
customer_cleaned_output.csv
```

It contains:
- Clean names  
- Extracted first/last names  
- Normalised emails  
- Validated ages  
- Consistent dates  
- Clean missing values  
- Sorted rows
